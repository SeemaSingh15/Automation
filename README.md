# Automation
This is my first ever project. Which is basically automating the process of saving our contacts and sending message via whatsapp. In this project i have use python language and help of appium server. This is designed for my device which is samsung m12. I know the front end is not good but hey its my first project. 
I would request you to open the "yourfront.py" file since the full code is in that. The rest of the files are of the other codes or say snippts of codes. For my simplicity( i am a beginner) i just kept my whole code in only one file i.e "yourfront.py".
ps: I am a beginner. If any mistakes i would love to know and learn from them.
